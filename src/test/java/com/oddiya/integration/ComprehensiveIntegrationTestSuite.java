    /**
     * Test Execution Strategy:
     * 
     * 1. Each test class uses @DirtiesContext to ensure clean state
     * 2. Tests are ordered within classes using @TestMethodOrder
     * 3. Transaction boundaries are properly managed with @Transactional
     * 4. Real HTTP calls are made using TestRestTemplate
     * 5. Database state is verified using repository beans
     * 6. Async operations are properly synchronized
     * 7. Error scenarios are comprehensively covered
     * 8. Resource cleanup is validated after each test class
     * 
     * Performance Considerations:
     * - Tests use H2 in-memory database for speed
     * - Minimal external dependencies for reliability
     * - Efficient test data setup and teardown
     * - Optimized query patterns to reduce test execution time
     * - Parallel test execution where safe
     * 
     * Maintenance Guidelines:
     * - Add new integration tests to appropriate existing classes
     * - Maintain test isolation and independence
     * - Update test data when domain models change
     * - Ensure test names clearly describe functionality
     * - Keep assertions specific and meaningful
     * - Document complex test scenarios and edge cases
