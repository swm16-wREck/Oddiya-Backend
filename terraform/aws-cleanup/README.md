# AWS Resource Cleanup Module

Automated identification and removal of unused AWS resources to reduce costs. This Terraform module deploys a Lambda function that regularly scans your AWS account for unused resources and can automatically delete them.

## üéØ Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Daily scans for unused resources
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test what would be deleted without actually deleting
- **Whitelist Protection**: Protect critical resources with tags or name prefixes
- **Email Notifications**: Get reports of cleaned resources
- **Cost Savings Estimation**: See potential monthly savings
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Cleans 12+ resource types

## üí∞ Potential Savings

| Resource Type | Typical Monthly Cost | Savings Potential |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Unattached EBS Volumes | $10-50 per volume | High |
| Unused Elastic IPs | $3.60 per IP | Medium |
| Unused NAT Gateways | $45 per gateway | High |
| Unused Load Balancers | $18-25 per ALB | High |
| Old EBS Snapshots | $0.05 per GB | Medium |
| Old RDS Snapshots | $0.095 per GB | Medium |
| Old AMI Images | $0.05 per GB | Low |
| CloudWatch Logs | $0.50 per GB | Medium |
| **Total Potential** | **$100-500+** | **Per Month** |

## üìã Resources Cleaned

1. **EBS Volumes** - Unattached volumes older than threshold
2. **EBS Snapshots** - Snapshots not associated with AMIs
3. **Elastic IPs** - Unassociated Elastic IPs
4. **Load Balancers** - ALBs/NLBs without targets
5. **NAT Gateways** - Unused NAT gateways
6. **RDS Snapshots** - Manual snapshots older than threshold
7. **AMI Images** - Custom AMIs older than threshold
8. **ECR Images** - Old container images (keeps last 10)
9. **CloudWatch Logs** - Empty log groups
10. **S3 Buckets** - Empty buckets older than threshold
11. **Security Groups** - Unused security groups
12. **Lambda Versions** - Old function versions (keeps last 3)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.5.0
- Appropriate AWS permissions

### 2. Deploy in Dry Run Mode (Recommended First)

```bash
# Clone or copy the module
cd terraform/aws-cleanup

# Copy and customize variables
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars - KEEP dry_run = true initially

# Deploy
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 3. Test Manual Scan

```bash
# Trigger a manual cleanup scan
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name aws-cleanup-resource-cleanup \
  --region ap-northeast-2 \
  /tmp/cleanup-output.json

# Check the results
cat /tmp/cleanup-output.json | jq
```

### 4. Review Results

- Check your email for the cleanup report
- Review CloudWatch logs for detailed information
- Access the dashboard URL from Terraform outputs

### 5. Enable Active Cleanup

Once satisfied with dry run results:

```hcl
# In terraform.tfvars, change:
dry_run = false

# Apply changes
terraform apply
```

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
aws_region = "ap-northeast-2"
prefix     = "my-cleanup"
dry_run    = true  # Set to false to enable deletion

# Schedule - Examples:
schedule_expression = "rate(1 day)"          # Daily
schedule_expression = "rate(7 days)"         # Weekly  
schedule_expression = "cron(0 2 * * ? *)"    # 2 AM UTC daily

# Minimum age before deletion
resource_age_threshold_days = 30

# Notification emails
notification_emails = ["team@example.com"]
```

### Selective Cleanup

Disable specific resource types:

```hcl
cleanup_config = {
  ebs_volumes         = true
  ebs_snapshots       = true
  elastic_ips         = true
  load_balancers      = false  # Don't clean load balancers
  nat_gateways        = false  # Don't clean NAT gateways
  rds_snapshots       = true
  ami_images          = true
  ecr_images          = true
  cloudwatch_logs     = true
  s3_buckets          = false  # Don't clean S3 buckets
  security_groups     = true
  old_lambda_versions = true
}
```

### Protection Rules

Protect resources with tags or name prefixes:

```hcl
# Resources with these tags won't be deleted
whitelist_tags = [
  "Environment:prod",
  "Protected",
  "DoNotDelete",
  "Critical"
]

# Resources with these name prefixes won't be deleted
whitelist_name_prefixes = [
  "prod-",
  "production-",
  "critical-",
  "backup-"
]
```

## üìä Monitoring

### CloudWatch Dashboard

Access the dashboard URL from Terraform outputs:
```bash
terraform output dashboard_url
```

### CloudWatch Logs

View detailed logs:
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/aws-cleanup-resource-cleanup --follow
```

### Email Reports

Reports include:
- Resources identified for cleanup
- Resources actually deleted (if not dry run)
- Estimated monthly savings
- Any errors encountered

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

1. **Dry Run by Default** - Won't delete anything until explicitly enabled
2. **Age Threshold** - Only deletes resources older than specified days
3. **Whitelist Protection** - Critical resources can be protected
4. **Production Safeguards** - Production resources protected by default
5. **Detailed Logging** - All actions are logged for audit
6. **Email Notifications** - Get notified of all cleanup activities

## üìà Cost Impact

### Example Monthly Savings

For a typical AWS account with moderate usage:

| Before Cleanup | After Cleanup | Monthly Savings |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| $1,500 | $1,200 | $300 (20%) |

### ROI Timeline

- **Day 1**: Identify unused resources
- **Week 1**: Clean up obvious waste (30-50% of savings)
- **Month 1**: Establish regular cleanup routine
- **Month 3**: Achieve 80-90% of potential savings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Before Running in Production

1. **Review Whitelist Rules** - Ensure critical resources are protected
2. **Test in Dry Run** - Always test with dry_run = true first
3. **Start Conservative** - Use longer age thresholds initially
4. **Monitor Closely** - Watch the first few cleanup runs carefully
5. **Backup Critical Data** - Ensure important snapshots are tagged

### Permissions Required

The Lambda function needs broad permissions to scan and delete resources. Review the IAM policy in `main.tf` to understand what permissions are granted.

### Limitations

- Only cleans resources in the specified region
- Some resources may have dependencies preventing deletion
- AWS API rate limits may affect large-scale cleanups
- Some resources may incur deletion costs (e.g., early deletion fees)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No resources found for cleanup**
- Check age threshold (might be too high)
- Verify resources exist in the specified region
- Check if resources are whitelisted

**Deletion failures**
- Check for resource dependencies
- Verify IAM permissions
- Look for AWS service limits

**Not receiving emails**
- Confirm SNS subscription
- Check spam folder
- Verify email address in terraform.tfvars

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**
   - Review cleanup reports weekly
   - Adjust thresholds based on your usage patterns
   - Update whitelist rules as needed

2. **Tagging Strategy**
   - Tag production resources with "Environment:prod"
   - Tag critical resources with "DoNotDelete"
   - Use consistent naming conventions

3. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Start with non-critical resource types
   - Begin with longer age thresholds
   - Reduce thresholds gradually

4. **Cost Tracking**
   - Monitor AWS Cost Explorer before/after
   - Track savings over time
   - Adjust strategy based on results

## üö® Emergency Stop

To immediately stop all cleanup operations:

```bash
# Disable the EventBridge rule
aws events disable-rule \
  --name aws-cleanup-cleanup-schedule \
  --region ap-northeast-2

# Or destroy the entire module
terraform destroy
```
